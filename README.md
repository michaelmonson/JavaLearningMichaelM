# Michael's Repository of Java Learning
What follows within this repository is an eclectic mix of projects and test classes that I am using to become more proficient in the Java language.  Although most of the exercises contained within here are simple, all of it is intended to help with the learning process.

The following sections can be found:
* Exercises on concurrency and threading
* Code Kata's : A list of interesting puzzles and solutions gleaned from a variety of code challenge sites
* Exercise files : Random classes containing quick logic for testing certain key features of Java.

_More to come later..._
